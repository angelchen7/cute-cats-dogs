# Materials for the August 3, 2023 NCEAS Roundtable

## Setup

This repository contains materials that accompany the talk/workshop, **Just enough CSS (and Sass) for data scientists** ([slides](https://samanthacsik.github.io/just-enough-css-sass/#/title-slide)).

If you'd like to follow along during the workshop, please take a moment to grab these materials by either forking/cloning or downloading the repo. You can find instructions for both options, below:

- If you **don't** have git/GitHub configured: [Instructions for downloading the GitHub repository to work locally](https://github.com/samanthacsik/cute-cats-dogs/wiki/Download-the-GitHub-repository-to-work-locally)
- If you **do** have git/GitHub configured: [Instructions for forking & cloning a GitHub respository](https://github.com/samanthacsik/cute-cats-dogs/wiki/Forking-&-Cloning-a-GitHub-respository)
